            <p>When the aliens arrived at Earth, they conducted scientific experiments on animals. One of these test subjects was a cow named Tauno.
                The alien experiments inadvertently altered Tauno, granting it the ability to teleport from one place to another.
                Thanks to its newfound abilities, Tauno managed to escape from the aliens, and no one has been able to catch it since.
                However, the aliens had installed a tracker on Tauno, and by following its signal, you can see Tauno's current location.
                You can try pressing the tracker button below to see where Tauno is right now. Oh and remember that Tauno is a cow,
                so he may sometimes teleport in the most unusual places...for example, in the middle of the sea...</p>
