             <p>It's the year 2586, and humanity has developed its technology to the highest
                level, overcoming a long battle against climate change. Life thrives in harmony
                as all countries have banned and ultimately forgotten environmentally harmful
                energy sources, replaced by eco-friendly alternatives championed by top advocates.
                However, Earth now faces an even darker fate as evil aliens suddenly arrive.
                These terrifying aliens come with the intention of conquering the world and
                annihilating humanity. They threaten to unleash a deadly virus designed to wipe
                out mankind.</p>

             <p>You are part of a resistance movement whose goal is to prevent the aliens
                intentions and save humanity from destruction. Together with top scientists,
                you have developed an antidote to the aliens deadly virus in a secret laboratory
                near Jose Marti International Airport in Cuba. However, creating the antidote
                requires an ancient ingredient. According to the laboratory's lead scientist
                Alex Zen, ingredient is found only in a super laboratory, located in an extremely
                secretive location near Oslo Airport in Norway.</p>

             <p>You have been chosen for the mission to retrieve this ingredient from Norway
                and safely transport it back to the resistance headquarters in Cuba,
                where the antidote can be manufactured. Your journey won't be easy.
                The aliens are intelligent they know about your plan regarding the antibody.
                They also have garnered supporters among humanity who are not keen on the
                resistance's plans and want to prevent your actions. You must take a circuitous
                route, overcome various challenges and deceive the aliens and their supporters
                along the way to succeed in your mission and save humanity from destruction.
                The fate of the world is in your hands. Good luck!</p>
